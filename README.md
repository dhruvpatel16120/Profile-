# 🚀 Gas Agency System — Full Development Roadmap (4 Weeks / 8 Phases)

## 📋 Overview
This is a **full-stack Next.js application** that provides:
- **User Dashboard** — for customers to book gas cylinders, make payments, view booking history, and get notices.
- **Admin Dashboard** — for agency staff to manage bookings, payments, deliveries, users, and announcements.
- **Database** — PostgreSQL hosted on Railway, managed with Prisma ORM.
- **Auth** — Firebase Authentication (Email+Password, Google SSO) for users, NextAuth.js (Credentials) for admins.
- **Payments** — Razorpay Payment Gateway.
- **Emails** — Gmail SMTP for transactional messages (order confirmations, booking updates).
- **UI/UX** — Tailwind CSS, responsive, modern, **Orange (#ff6600) + Black (#000000)** light theme.

## ⚡ Advanced Resource Optimization Techniques

### **1. Debouncing & Throttling**
- **When to use**:
  - Search input boxes (user list, booking history filters, notice search).
  - Live form validation.
  - Scroll-based event triggers.
- **Implementation Guidelines**:
  - Create a reusable `useDebounce` hook for inputs.
  - Use throttling for repetitive background API calls (e.g., booking status polling).

---

### **2. Lazy Loading & Code Splitting**
- Lazy-load dashboard components that are not immediately visible.
- Example: Load `BookingHistoryTable` only when the user navigates to that tab.
- Use Next.js `dynamic()` import for large modules like charts and data tables.

---

### **3. Database Query Optimization**
- Add Prisma query filters to only select needed fields instead of `select: *`.
- Always paginate large queries.
- Add indexes for:
  - `createdAt` on all main tables.
  - `status` for bookings.
  - `email` for users/admins.

---

### **4. Server-Side Caching**
- Use in-memory caching (e.g., `lru-cache`) for:
  - Frequently accessed data like notices or dashboard stats.
- Apply short TTL (time-to-live) for freshness.

---

### **5. API Request Batching**
- Batch multiple small requests into a single API call when possible.
- Example: Fetch booking stats + pending requests count in one endpoint.

---

### **6. Image & Asset Optimization**
- Use Next.js `<Image>` for automatic image optimization.

---

### **7. Client-Side State Management**
- Use React Query or SWR for data fetching:
  - Automatic caching
  - Background refetch
  - Reduces unnecessary API calls

---

### **8. Form Handling Efficiency**
- Use form libraries like `react-hook-form` to minimize re-renders.
- Combine validation with Zod for type safety.

---

### **9. Prevent Overfetching**
- Only refetch data when it changes:
  - Use `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` in SWR/React Query.
  - Use WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for live updates instead of polling.

---

### **10. Pre-rendering & Incremental Static Regeneration**
- Use `getServerSideProps` for dynamic pages that must be fresh on each request.
- Use `getStaticProps` + revalidation for rarely changing pages like Notices.

---

## 📌 Additional Functional Requirements (From Project Specification)

### **Initial Cylinder Allocation**
- On user registration:
  - Create a `cylinderBalance` field with a default value of **12**.
  - Create an `allocationExpiry` date set to **current date + 1 year**.
- Booking restrictions:
  - Users cannot book more cylinders if `cylinderBalance` is **0** and `allocationExpiry` is still in the future.
  - If allocation period has expired, balance resets to 12 automatically.
- Admin control:
  - Admin dashboard should include a **"Reset Balance"** button for individual users.
  - Option to adjust cylinder balance manually.

---

### **Additional Payment Methods**
- **Cash on Delivery (COD)**:
  - User can select COD during checkout.
  - Booking record is created with `paymentStatus = PENDING` and `paymentMethod = COD`.
  - Admin can later mark COD payment as received.
- **Paytm QR Code Payment**:
  - Display static Paytm QR code on checkout page.
  - Allow users to enter **transaction ID** and upload a **payment screenshot**.
  - Admin reviews and marks payment as successful.
- Maintain consistent payment status tracking for all methods.

---

### **Account Balance Emails**
- After every booking/payment:
  - Send an email showing:
    - Booking details
    - Payment confirmation
    - Updated cylinder balance
    - Allocation expiry date
- Use Gmail SMTP for sending transactional emails.
- Templates should be consistent and professional.

---

### **Expanded Logging**
- Log **all CRUD actions** across the system, including:
  - User login attempts (success/failure)
  - User registration
  - Booking creation, update, deletion
  - Payment status updates
  - Profile updates
  - Admin actions (approvals, rejections, notice creation)
- Include:
  - Timestamp
  - Performed by (User ID / Admin ID)
  - Action description
  - Related entity ID

---

## 🛠 Quality & Coding Guidelines
- **Code Style**
  - Use PascalCase for React components.
  - No inline CSS; use Tailwind classes.
  - Keep logic and UI separate.
  - Avoid deeply nested components; split into smaller, reusable parts.
- **Architecture**
  - Use `services/` folder for DB operations.
  - Keep API handlers in `app/api/` and group by feature.
  - Shared constants and validation schemas in `utils/`.
- **Modularity**
  - Each feature (Bookings, Payments, Notices, Users) should have:
    - Its own API endpoints
    - Its own React components
    - Its own service functions
- **Security**
  - Validate all inputs using Zod.
  - Sanitize user input to prevent XSS.
  - Role-based checks in all API routes.
- **Performance**
  - Use pagination for all tables.
  - Implement database indexes for frequently queried fields.

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios & Expected Results

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **1. User Registration** | Register new user with valid data | Account created, `cylinderBalance = 12`, `allocationExpiry = +1 year` |
| **2. Booking with Razorpay** | Book a cylinder, pay via Razorpay | Payment verified, booking status updated, cylinder balance reduced |
| **3. Booking with COD** | Book using COD method | Booking created with `paymentStatus = PENDING`, admin can approve |
| **4. Booking with Paytm QR** | Book using Paytm QR, enter transaction ID | Booking created, admin verifies payment |
| **5. Cylinder Balance Restriction** | Try to book with balance = 0 | Booking denied with error message |
| **6. Annual Balance Reset** | Simulate expiry date passed | Balance resets to 12 |
| **7. Admin Notice Update** | Create new notice | Notice visible to users instantly |
| **8. Payment Failure Handling** | Fail payment intentionally | Booking status = PENDING, user notified |
| **9. Email Notification** | Make successful booking | Email received with updated balance and booking details |
| **10. Unauthorized Route Access** | Access `/admin/*` without login | Redirected to admin login |
